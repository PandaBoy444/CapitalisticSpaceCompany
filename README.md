# Capitalistic SPACE Company

As the head of a crumbling, inherented, capitalistic space company, you are forced to use the last card you have left, the rights to a small, dead, iiradiated planet called earth. 

Earth is mostly depleated in resources, and has a high concentration of hostile life. You must take the planet, and sell as much as possible back  to the hungy society of the "United SPACE consumer union plus plus" in order to reastablish your company as the "top shelf", "high volume production", "safe importer/exporter" "wheelchair accessible" winner it once was. You will need to build factories and trade routes create lasting relationships, compete with rivals and backstab your way to the top.

~~[using the COMBAT module]  
The planet won't stand idly by while you try to get rich from it's lifebloodâ€¦ With a healthy combination of angry locals and an ever evolving rising threat, you will have your work cut out for you, defending your factories and slowly expanding your empire will require immense infrastructure and huge amount of manufactured (or bought) bullets.~~

# Gameplay components
- Factories! - 
    You will be pushed to your limits manufacturing many things in intricate ways. Complex logistics puzzles, uniqe assembly lines and crazy machinery. Those along with a lack of easy solutions to save you will force you to put your mind to the meat grinder.
- Trade and Economy!
    You will trade back and forth with many different companies for different reasons, each company can help you with specific things and each has their needs and wants. An economy that is affected by each small move. You might stop suppling wood to the main coal coke supplier of *Zero-G toiletries* which forces them to stop making synthetic marble
